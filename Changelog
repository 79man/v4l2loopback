- check incorrect video options (width/height/fps) values
- increase of the framerate accuracy
- possibility to choose the framerate management :
	* fps = 0 : no framerate. Input video stream is read by device as
	fast as it is written to the device
	* fps > 0 : the framerate is set to the given value
	* fps < 0 : framerate is synchonized on the reader application



0.1.2 :
- add control options :
	* you can specify option "fps" which regulates the framerate
	* video properties (width/height/fps) can now be changed after the module
	has been loaded. To do that, just send the exact following ASCI sequence to the
	device :
		"width=[new_video_width] height=[new_video_height] fps=[new_video_fps]"
		example: 
			echo "width=800 height=600 fps=25" > /dev/video0



0.1.1 :
- correction to make it possible to use AVLD with others existing video
devices
